##  Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get Knockout Gear running on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **PHP:** Version **7.4** or higher
  * **MySQL:** Version **5.7** or higher
  * **Web Server:** Apache (commonly available via **XAMPP**, **WAMP**, or similar stacks)
  * **Browser:** A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/knockout_gear.git
    cd knockout_gear
    ```

2.  **Set Up the Database:**

      * Create a MySQL database named `knockout_gear`.

      * Import the `boxing_store.sql` file into your newly created database. Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username when executing the command:

        ```bash
        mysql -u your_username -p knockout_gear < boxing_store.sql
        ```

      * **Update `config/db_connect.php`** with your MySQL credentials:

        ```php
        <?php
        $host = 'localhost';
        $dbname = 'knockout_gear';
        $username = 'your_username'; // Your MySQL username
        $password = 'your_password'; // Your MySQL password
        ?>
        ```

3.  **Configure the Web Server:**

      * Place the entire `boxing_store` folder into your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
      * Ensure the `images/products/` directory has **write permissions** to allow administrators to upload product images (e.g., `chmod 777 images/products/` on Linux/macOS, or adjust permissions via your OS's file explorer).

4.  **Add Images and Video:**

      * Verify that the following files are present in the `images/` directory:
          * `store_logo.png`
          * `hero_video.mp4`
          * `ring_pattern.png`
      * Ensure product images are organized within their respective subdirectories (e.g., `images/products/gloves/pro_boxing_gloves.jpg`). The `image_path` in your `products` table must match these paths.

5.  **Start the Server:**

      * Start your Apache and MySQL services (e.g., using the XAMPP control panel).
      * Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost/boxing_store/` in your web browser.
